# 1. Create a function thats gives you the average of numbers
#    in any list. Do not use the python inbuilt funtion to achieve this.

# 2. Create a funtion that returns the multiplication table of any
#    number passed to it

# 3. Use Lamda and List comprehension to create a function that can add 
#    numbers from a lower limit to an upper limit. Call this functon three times
#    with different values
